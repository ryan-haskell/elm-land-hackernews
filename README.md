> my first project with Elm Land

We built this live on Twitch during the [The Claw's June 22 Raidathon](https://theclaw.team/raidathon), and it's based off an in-progress version of [Elm Land](https://elm.land).

You can see a demo here: [https://elm-land-hn.netlify.app](https://elm-land-hn.netlify.app) or run it yourself with this command ðŸ‘‡


## local development
